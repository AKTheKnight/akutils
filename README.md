A minecraft mod filled with my random ideas


### How my versioning works:
A typical mod release will have a version listing something like 1.9-1.2.3 or 1.8.9-1.4.6

The first part is the minecraft version the mod release is for

The first number in the second part second part is what version the mod is in. Most of my mods will stay at 1 unless I rewrite it or enough changes in a minecraft update happen that I feel I can justify changing the version

The second number in this part is just to do with adding things to the mod. If I add a major new thing/s then I will update this number

The final number is fixes, everytime i make a fix or small change and then commit them a value is added. This is reset to 0 every time the second number changes.

##### Example:
If we have a mod on minecraft 1.8 with version 1.0.0 and I find a bug and fix it, it will become 1.0.1

If I then add a major feature to it, it then becomes 1.1.0
